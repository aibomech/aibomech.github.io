    <!-- <h3>Robot Manipulators Design - Part 2</h3> -->
    <p>Robot manipulators are everywhere in modern automation ‚Äî from factories to service robots. In this post, we‚Äôll go over the key basics that every robotics engineer should know before designing a robot arm.</p>
  
    <h4>üìã 3 Things to Know Before Starting</h4>
    <p>Before you design a robot arm, ask yourself these important questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. What task will the robot do?</strong><br>
      Will it lift, move, weld, or assemble something? The task helps you decide the structure and capabilities.</li>
  
      <li><strong>2. Where will the robot work?</strong><br>
      This is called the workspace ‚Äî the area the robot must reach and move in. You need to know the size, shape, and environment.</li>
  
      <li><strong>3. What will the robot carry?</strong><br>
      The weight (payload) affects the material choice, joint design, and motor power. You want it strong, but not too heavy!</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>üîç Why Robot Arms Matter</h4>
    <p>Robot arms bring huge benefits to industry and daily life. They help to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Save time and reduce production delays</li>
      <li>Cut labor costs and improve return on investment</li>
      <li>Protect humans from dangerous or boring tasks</li>
      <li>Reduce errors and improve quality</li>
      <li>Work non-stop, 24/7, with no breaks!</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>ü¶æ Robot Arm vs Human Arm</h4>
    <p>Robot arms are inspired by the human arm. Here's how they compare:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Base:</strong> Like the human torso</li>
      <li><strong>Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist:</strong> Give the arm flexibility and reach</li>
      <li><strong>End Effector:</strong> Like the hand ‚Äî it grabs or moves things</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both are designed to reach, grip, and move objects ‚Äî just in different ways.</p>
  
    <h4>üìê How to Define the Workspace</h4>
    <p>The <strong>workspace</strong> is the area the robot arm can reach. There are two main ways to analyze it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Graphical Method:</strong> Use CAD software to draw the robot and see its movement range visually.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytical Method:</strong> Use geometry and math formulas to calculate reach based on joint lengths and angles.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>‚úÖ Compare both methods to check your accuracy. If they match, you‚Äôre on the right track!</p>
