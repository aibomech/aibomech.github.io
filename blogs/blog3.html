    <h3>Robot Manipulators Design - Part 2</h3>
    <p>Robot manipulators are widely used in modern automated systems. In this post, we‚Äôll explore some fundamental concepts every robotics engineer should understand before designing a manipulator.</p>

    <h4>üìå What You Need to Know Before Designing a Robot Arm</h4>
    <p>Before starting the design process, consider the following three key points:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Define the Task:</strong> Know exactly what the robot is supposed to do. This helps in selecting the right configuration and functionality.</li>
      <li><strong>2. Identify the Workspace:</strong> Understand the environment where the robot will operate, including how far it needs to reach and from which directions.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Choose Construction Based on Payload:</strong> Depending on how much weight the end effector needs to lift, you can choose appropriate materials, element shapes, and dimensions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>‚öôÔ∏è Why Robot Arms Are Important</h4>
    <p>Robot manipulators offer many advantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Save time and increase manufacturing efficiency</li>
      <li>Quick return on investment</li>
      <li>Reduce human exposure to dangerous or boring tasks</li>
      <li>Improve accuracy and reduce errors</li>
      <li>Work continuously 24/7 without fatigue</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>ü¶æ Robot Arm vs. Human Arm</h4>
    <p>A robot manipulator has parts similar to a human arm:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Base:</strong> Like the human body</li>
      <li><strong>Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist:</strong> These provide mobility and flexibility</li>
      <li><strong>End Effector:</strong> Acts like the human hand to perform tasks</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>üó∫Ô∏è Understanding the Workspace</h4>
    <p>The workspace is the area the robot arm can reach. We use two main methods to study it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Graphical Method:</strong> Use CAD software to draw the robot and visualize its reachable area.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytical Method:</strong> Use geometric shapes and algebra to derive mathematical models of the workspace.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To ensure the design is correct, compare the results from both methods. If they match, your analysis is likely accurate.</p>
