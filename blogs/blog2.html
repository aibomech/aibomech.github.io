    <!-- <h3>Robot Manipulators Design - Part 1</h3> -->
    <p>Robot manipulators are incredibly exciting â€” theyâ€™re like the arms of a robot, giving it the ability to pick things up, move them, or even assemble components. In this post, Iâ€™ll walk you through the basics of robot manipulators and share a bit about our experience building one from scratch.</p>
  
    <h4>ðŸ¤–What Exactly Is a Robot Manipulator?</h4>
    <p>Think of a robot manipulator as the robotic version of a human arm. Itâ€™s designed to perform physical tasks such as moving, gripping, or positioning objects. Youâ€™ll find them everywhere â€” in factories assembling cars, in hospitals assisting surgeons, or even at home inside robotic vacuum cleaners and personal assistant bots!</p>
  
    <h4>ðŸ”§ 4 Key Components When Designing a Robot Manipulator</h4>
    <p>Creating a robot arm isnâ€™t just about putting parts together â€” it involves bringing several systems into harmony. Here are the four core components you need to consider:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Mechanical Design:</strong> The skeleton of the arm â€” made up of links, joints, and materials that provide strength and flexibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Electronics:</strong> Includes motors, sensors, and wiring that power the arm and connect it to the robotâ€™s control system.</li>
    <li><strong>Control Systems:</strong> The smart mechanism that ensures the arm moves precisely and safely.</li>
    <li><strong>Programming:</strong> The code that instructs the robot on what actions to take and when.</li>
  </ul>

    <h4>ðŸ’¡ Our Experience Designing a Robot Manipulator</h4>
    <p>Weâ€™ve been through a lot while designing our own robot manipulator. It wasnâ€™t easy, but it was rewarding. By focusing on the four key partsâ€”mechanical design, electronics, control systems, and programmingâ€”we were able to create an arm that could actually perform tasks. But thereâ€™s still much more to explore, and weâ€™ll continue improving it!</p>
  
    <h4>ðŸš€ Why This is Just the Beginning</h4>
    <p>Designing a robot manipulator is a big job, so weâ€™ve decided to break it down into multiple parts. This blog is the first in a series where Iâ€™ll go deeper into each part of the design process. In future posts, weâ€™ll talk about things like choosing the right parts, programming the arm, and using sensors to improve its capabilities!</p>
  
    <h4>ðŸŽ¥ Whatâ€™s Coming in Part-2 ?</h4>
    <p>In the upcoming blogs, weâ€™ll look at:
    <ul>
      <li>How to select the best parts for your robot manipulator</li>
      <li>How to write the code that tells the robot what to do</li>
      <li>How to add sensors that help the robot understand its environment</li>
    </ul>
