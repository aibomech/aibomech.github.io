    <h3>Robot Kinematics & Dynamics: Basic Definitions and Design</h3>
    <p>To build a robot arm that works in real life, we must first understand how it moves and how its parts work together. This starts with learning about its structure and motion — known as kinematics and dynamics.</p>
  
    <h4> Basic Parts of a Robot Arm</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Links:</strong> These are solid parts that form the body of the robot. Each link connects to the next through a joint.</li>
      <li><strong>Joints:</strong> Joints allow movement between links. They can rotate or slide.</li>
      <li><strong>Actuators:</strong> Motors or devices that move the joints.</li>
      <li><strong>Transmissions:</strong> Systems like gears or pulleys that pass motion from actuators to joints.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensors & Controllers:</strong> Sensors collect info like position or force. Controllers use this to move the robot correctly.</li>
      <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Allows a person to control or monitor the robot.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4> Designing the Mechanism</h4>
    <p>Once we know the task and space the robot will work in, we design the arm's shape. There is no single perfect design. It depends on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How far and how flexible the robot must reach</li>
      <li>How heavy the objects are</li>
      <li>How fast and precise it must be</li>
      <li>Cost and ease of building it</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example: If the robot must cut plastic sheets, we design the arm based on the space available, cutting speed, and plastic type.</p>
  
    <h4>Kinematic Analysis</h4>
    <p>Kinematics is about motion — not forces. It includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Position:</strong> Where the robot's tool is and how it is oriented</li>
      <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> How fast the joints or end are moving</li>
      <li><strong>Acceleration:</strong> How quickly the speed changes</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Dynamic Analysis</h4>
    <p>Dynamics deals with forces and torques. It helps us answer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How much torque is needed at each joint?</li>
      <li>What motors are suitable?</li>
      <li>How much power is required?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These answers are key to choosing the right motors and ensuring the robot works safely and effectively.</p>
