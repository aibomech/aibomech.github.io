    <!-- <h3>Robot Arm Kinematics & Dynamics: Basic Definitions and Design</h3> -->
    <p>To build a robot that works in real life, we must first understand how it moves and how its parts work together. This starts with learning about its structure and motion — known as kinematics and dynamics.</p>
  
    <h4> What Are the Main Parts of a Robot Arm?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Links:</strong> These are solid parts that form the body of the robot. Each link connects to the next through a joint.</li>
      <li><strong>Joints:</strong> Joints allow movement between links. They can rotate(Revolute Joint) or slide(Prismatic Joint).</li>
      <li><strong>Actuators:</strong> Motors or devices that move the joints.</li>
      <li><strong>Transmissions:</strong> Systems like gears or pulleys that pass motion from actuators to joints.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensors & Controllers:</strong> Sensors collect info like position or force. Controllers use this to move the robot correctly.</li>
      <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Allows a person to control or monitor the robot Function.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>How Do We Design a Robot Arm?</h4>
      <p>The design depends on what the robot needs to do. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. We ask:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How far does it need to reach?</li>
      <li>How heavy are the objects it will handle?</li>
      <li>How fast and accurate should it be?</li>
      <li>What is the budget and complexity of building it?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Example:</em> If a robot needs to cut plastic sheets, we’ll design its arm based on space, cutting speed, and material strength.</p>
  
    <h4>Kinematics: Motion Without Forces</h4>
    <p>Kinematics is all about how the robot moves:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Position:</strong> Where is the end of the arm and how is it angled?</li>
      <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> How fast is it moving?</li>
      <li><strong>Acceleration:</strong> How quickly does the speed change?</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4> Dynamics: Adding Forces to the Picture</h4>
      <p>Dynamics helps us figure out what power is needed to make those movements. We ask:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>How much torque is needed at each joint?</li>
      <li>Which motors can provide that torque?</li>
      <li>How much energy does the robot need?</li>
      </ul>
    <p>This helps us pick the right motors and keep the robot working smoothly and safely.</p>

    <h4> Final Thoughts</h4>
    <p>Understanding kinematics and dynamics is the first step in building smart, safe, and effective robots. It’s like giving robots a skeleton, muscles, and brain to move the way we want.</p>
