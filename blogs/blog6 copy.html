  <!-- <h3>🛠️ Arduino Microcontroller Basics</h3> -->
  <p>The <strong>Arduino microcontroller</strong> is the perfect starting point for anyone interested in robotics and small mechatronic systems. It’s beginner-friendly, open-source, and widely used in both education and industry. Whether you're building a hobby project or a business idea, Arduino gives you the tools to make it real.</p>

  <h4>🚀 Why Start with Arduino?</h4>
  <p>Arduino is more than just a chip — it’s a full kit designed to help you learn by doing. With basic components like sensors, motors, and LEDs, you can start building real-world systems from day one. No complicated setup. Just plug, code, and play.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Open-source:</strong> Free to use and modify.</li>
    <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> Millions of users around the world.</li>
    <li><strong>Beginner-Friendly:</strong> Simple hardware and easy-to-learn programming.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>💡 What Can You Do with Arduino?</h4>
  <p>Arduino is used in all kinds of applications — from smart homes to robotics and wearable tech. It helps you understand how things around you work, and how to control them. You can even turn your ideas into products or services.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Build Robots:</strong> Control motors, sensors, and movements.</li>
    <li><strong>Smart Systems:</strong> Automate lights, temperature, or security.</li>
    <li><strong>IoT Projects:</strong> Connect your devices to the internet.</li>
    <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Test product ideas quickly and cheaply.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>🎯 Combine CAD & Arduino for Real Projects</h4>
  <p>Want to go beyond coding? Arduino integrates well with mechanical design. For example, you can design parts in <strong>SolidWorks</strong>, then control them using Arduino. This combination of CAD (design) and CAM (control) is powerful for engineers and makers.</p>

  <h4>📦 What’s in an Arduino Kit?</h4>
  <p>If you’re just getting started, you’ll want a full Arduino kit. These kits usually include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Arduino board (like Uno or Nano)</li>
    <li>LEDs, resistors, and jumper wires</li>
    <li>Motors and servo drivers</li>
    <li>Sensors for temperature, motion, and more</li>
    <li>USB cable and power supply</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These tools make learning fun and hands-on. You don’t need to be an expert to start — just curious!</p>
