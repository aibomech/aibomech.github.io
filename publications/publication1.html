<h3>Multi-Head Attention-Based Framework with Residual Network for Human Action Recognition</h3>
<p>
This paper proposes a deep learning framework combining ResNet-18, Bi-LSTM, and multi-head attention for accurate and efficient human action recognition. It achieves 96.60% accuracy on the UCF-101 dataset and was validated on a mobile robot for real-time deployment.
